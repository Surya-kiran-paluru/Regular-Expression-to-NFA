# Regular-Expression-to-NFA

Regular Expression:  Regular expressions are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.

NFA: NFA stands for non-deterministic finite automata. The finite automata are called NFA when there exist many paths for specific input from the current state to the next state.

The code above aims to return the transition table of a specific regular expressions.
